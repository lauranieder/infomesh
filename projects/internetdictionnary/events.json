In one of them, he imagined the “telelectroscope,” a device that used telephone wires to create a world-wide communication network that allowed users to get a peek at what people were doing at any given moment in any place on earth (if today’s social media landscape is any indication, they were probably taking tintypes of what they ate for breakfast). The story even features a murder suspect who is cleared of the crime when he’s able to locate the supposed victim alive and well via a livestream from a webcam filming a festival in China. Okay, not in those exact words. But essentially, what I’m saying is, Mark Twain invented the internet.",
